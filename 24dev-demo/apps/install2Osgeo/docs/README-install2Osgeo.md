# install2Osgeo Documentation 
* A repeatable 24dev-demo installation process that installs user/application profiles, purges log files and creates backups.
* Users can re-run the install script to update profile changes, and accept different 24dev-* programs.  
* Usage: Execute $APPS/install2Osgeo/bin/install2Osgeo.sh

## Screenshot Verification Process 
You can optionally include a verification screenshot with these steps: 
* Run your 24dev regression tests.
* Login to your 24dev github account, navigate to your latest tags/releases. 
* Click on your upper right profile tab that shows you are signed in.
* Open a terminal window and enter the verification commands listed on the [Project-Summary.md page](../../../../Project-Summary.md).
* Position the terminal and browser windows then execute the "screengrab" command.
* Save the image as "screen.png" into the [backup directory](../../../backup).
* Run the [install.sh](../bin) command, which will post your screenshot to the Project-Summary.md page.
